TASK 1 - Unit Converter App
This Unit Converter application is designed to assist users in converting units from one form to another with ease. The app accepts user input for various units and provides conversions to the desired units, such as converting centimeters to meters or grams to kilograms, and vice versa. The intuitive interface makes it easy for users to enter values and get accurate conversion results instantly.

This application was developed using Android Studio, with XML used to create a user-friendly interface and Java for the conversion functionality. It is the first task in a series of projects aimed at enhancing my skills in Android development.
